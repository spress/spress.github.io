                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>Hi community. I was working on Spress 2.3.0 whose only new feature would have been
the incremental site regeneration, an experimental feature that lets Spress to recompile
only the modified files in a site so it can save time and increments the performance.
From a year and some months ago I'm father and I don't have enough free time for all my
side projects so I have decided to focus my effors on Spress 3.0.0 (<a href="https://github.com/spress/spress">master branch</a>).
This version will work over PHP 7.2 (minimum version) and Symfony 4. I'll keep
you update about all the new features and changes.</p>

                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>Hi community. After several months working on Spress 2.2.0, it is here with 11
new features, 6 improvements and 8 fixes. The highlights of this release are
the <a href="/docs/themes">support for themes</a>, a little package manager based on
<a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> and the <strong>jumps to PHP 5.6 dropping the
support for 5.5</strong>. Additionally, an issue related with copying dot-files such as
<code>.htaccess</code> into <code>build</code> directory has been fixed.</p>

<h2>Themes</h2>

<p>Themes let you create sites based on community-maintained templates. These ones
package layouts, includes and assets in a way that can be
<a href="/docs/themes/#how-themes-work">overridden by your site content</a>.
Themes are published via <a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist.org</a>.
The <code>new:site</code> command has been updated to let you create a site based on any theme.
Additionaly, a <code>new:theme</code> command has been added to facilitate the task of create
a new theme. <a href="/docs/themes/#creating-a-new-theme">You can get more details about this one here</a>.</p>

                <title>Spress 2.2.0-rc is out. Help us to test</title>
                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>Hello community. Last Monday 16th of January I released the first <a href="https://github.com/spress/Spress/releases/tag/v2.2.0-rc">RC of
Spress 2.2.0</a>
(I think this will be the only RC). We need help for testing the new features.
This version comes with a few new features such as a <a href="https://github.com/spress/Spress/issues/96">package manager</a>, support for themes or the
migration of Symfony components from 2.7 to 3.2. This migration could throw some
excetions due to the deprecations introduced in Symfony Yaml component since version 2.8.
In the coming days I'm going to update the documentation
according to the new features. Additionaly, I'm going to review the themes
of <a href="https://github.com/spress-add-ons">Spress add-ons organization on Github</a>.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody. The development of Spress 2.2.0 continues on its way and today
I want to show you two new features: the support for themes and a new set of
commands aimed to manage Spress's add-ons.</p>

                <title>New in Spress 2.2.0: "avoid_renderizer" feature for type of files</title>
                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>Hello community! Spress is on the way to 2.2.0 and today we want to unveil
a <a href="https://github.com/spress/Spress/issues/91">new feature</a> for applying the <a href="docs/themes/#avoid-renderizer">"avoid_renderizer"</a>
feature automatically to both certain type of files and files that belong to a path.
The <code>avoid_renderizer</code> attribute let's avoid the <a href="/docs/developers/renderizer/">renderizer</a>
comes into action with a file. Prior to Spress 2.2.0, you needed to put this attribute
file by file. Now, you can set a filter in the <code>config.yml</code> file like the following:</p>

<pre><code class="yaml"># config.yml
avoid_renderizer:
  filename_extensions: ['css', 'js']
  paths: ['assets']
</code></pre>

<p>In the prior example, all files belonging to <code>assets</code> folder (this folder is relative
to <code>src/content</code> path) or those with a filename's extension type <code>css</code> or <code>js</code>
will receive an <code>avoid_renderizer: true</code> attribute unless otherwise expressly
provided in a file.</p>

<p>Spress comes with the following configuration by default:</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">avoid_renderizer:
  filename_extensions: ['css', 'js']
  paths: ['assets', 'bower_components', 'node_modules']
</code></pre>

                <title>Spress 2.1.3 released</title>
                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>Hello community. A new maintenance release of Spress has been released. The highlights
this time have been a fix related with the content of <code>title_path</code> attribute
in case of filenames with dots before extension (previously, the value of this attribute appears truncated).
Additionally, the value of <code>title_path</code> will no longer be altered by <code>FilesystemDataSource</code>
class, only <code>rawurlencode</code> function is applied. If you have a file called
<code>02-02-spress-2.1.1-released.md</code> then the value of <code>title_path</code> will be
<code>spress-2.1.1-released</code> instead of <code>spress-2-1-1-released</code>.</p>

<p>Another improvement has been the <a href="/docs/configuration/#plugin_manager_builder">option for avoid scanning certains directories</a>
such as <code>tests</code> when the plugin manager is loading classes in order to detect
which of those are plugins.</p>

<p>The complete changelog:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="label label-success">New</span> Class <code>FileInfo</code> has been added to the support classes set of the core.</li>
<li><span class="label label-success">New</span> New configuration value aimed to plugin manager builder for excluding directories in the disconvering class phase. Useful to avoid scaning test classes.</li>
<li><span class="label label-default">Fixed</span> Fixed the truncated <code>title_path</code> attribute when the filename contains dots before the extension. More details in bug #88.</li>
<li><span class="label label-default">Fixed</span> The value of <code>title_path</code> is not altered when it is parsed by <code>FilesystemDataSource</code> class. More details in bug #88.</li>
<li><span class="label label-default">Fixed</span> If you set <code>preserve_path_title</code> attribute to <code>true</code> you will get the title parsed from the filename as-is (without the date part). Only <code>rawurlencode</code> function is applied. See PR #90.</li>
</ul>

                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>Spress 1.1.0 is coming and this time we want to show you two new features:
the <strong>built-in server and the resource watcher</strong>. With the built-in server you
have a simple web server for viewing your site without any extra requirement.
To enable this server you can use <code>--server</code> option with <code>spress site:build</code> command.
The other feature included in this version is a resource watcher for watching for
changes and to regenerate your site automatically. To enable this feature you can
use <code>--watch</code> option with <code>spress site:build</code> command. Each option can be used individually.</p>

<pre><code>$ spress site:build --server --watch
</code></pre>

<p>By defacult the built-in server is listening <code>0.0.0.0:4000</code> accepting connections from any adress
by port 4000. If you want change this values you can add this lines to <code>config.yml</code> of your site
with your values:</p>

<pre><code>host: 'localhost'
port: 4000
</code></pre>

<p>This video show us how to work this new options:</p>

                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>The last days I have been working on splitting Spress into <a href="https://github.com/spress/Spress-core">Spress Core</a> and its ecosystem 
(console commands and others) as I was described in <a href="https://github.com/spress/Spress/issues/13">issue #13</a>.
Now you can include Spress Core in your PHP projects. This feature would be
useful for generating HTML content of a web project that have both dynamic and static responses.</p>

<h2>How to use?</h2>

<p>The first step is to add <code>yosymfony/spress-core</code> to your <code>require</code> section in <code>composer.json</code> and to execute
the <code>composer update</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "require": {
        "yosymfony/spress-core": "1.1.*@dev"
    }
}
</code></pre>

Spress 1.1.0. Prior to version 1.1.0 for each Plugin was necessary a <code>composer.json</code> file. Now this file is optional
and you can use it for distributable plugins with <a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist</a> or for plugins
with namespace.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p>The development of Spress 1.1.0 continues with new features like support to load configurations for
different environments. This is <strong>useful for writing configuration options for development
and production environments</strong>. Each Spress site has a <code>config.yml</code> file (mandatory) with the options
for the default environment (dev). If you want set options for production environment you can
to create a <code>config_prod.yml</code> file with the options that will be overrided in <code>config.yml</code>.
The command line option <code>--env</code> let you to enable the environment.</p>

                <title>How to create a contact form in Spress?</title>
                <description>
                    <![CDATA[<p>It's probably that soon or later you need to integrate a contact
form in your site. To do it, you can use <a href="http://getsimpleform.com/">Get simple form</a>
service that allows you setup forms with any kind of data. To use this service only
requires a token that you will receive by email.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="http://getsimpleform.com/messages?form_api_token=&lt;form_api_token&gt;" method="post"&gt;

    &lt;!-- 
        the redirect_to is optional, the form will 
        redirect to the referrer on submission 
    --&gt;
    &lt;input type='hidden' name='redirect_to' 
        value='&lt;e.g. http://yoursite.com/thank-you.html&gt;' /&gt;

    &lt;!-- all your input fields here.... --&gt;
    &lt;input type='text' name='test' /&gt;

    &lt;input type='submit' value='Test form' /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The above code shows us how to setup a form. The hidden field <strong>redirect_to</strong> allows us
set a redirect URL for when the form is submitted. For each form submitted you receive a email.</p>

                    <![CDATA[<p>After 3 <em>releases candidate</em>, the first stable version arrived. With this release you can
extend Spress with plugins and create themes that can be published at the
<a href="https://spress.yosymfony.com/add-ons">add-ons</a> page (you only need to send a tweet to
<a href="http://twitter.com/spress_cms/">@spress_cms</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/yosymfony/">@yosymfony</a>).</p>

<p>I'm starting to think in the new features of the next release and any suggestion
will be welcome. If you have some stuff, you can open a issue at
<a href="https://github.com/yosymfony/Spress/issues">Github page</a>.</p>
